The condition !username.empty() only checks if the string username is not empty. It doesn't check if the string is just composed of spaces.

For instance:

" " (a string of spaces) will pass the !username.empty() check because it's not technically empty.
However, it will fail the username != " " condition because, if username contains only one space, it's equal to " ".
So, if you want to ensure that the username is neither empty nor just a string of spaces, you should adjust the assertion like this:

```
assert(!username.empty() && username.find_first_not_of(' ') != std::string::npos);
```
This will ensure that:

The username is not empty.
The username has at least one character that isn't a space.
