### Common Big O notations, their descriptions in words, and typical examples:

1. **Constant Time: \(O(1)\)**
   - **Description**: The operation's time complexity is constant, not depending on the input size.
   - **Example**: Accessing an element in an array by its index.

2. **Logarithmic Time: \(O(\log n)\)**
   - **Description**: The operation's time complexity increases logarithmically with the input size. This is typical for operations that can halve the problem size at each step.
   - **Example**: Binary search in a sorted array.

3. **Linear Time: \(O(n)\)**
   - **Description**: The operation's time complexity grows linearly with the input size.
   - **Example**: Finding the maximum element in an unsorted array.

4. **Linearithmic Time: \(O(n\log n)\)**
   - **Description**: Combines linear and logarithmic complexities. It's more efficient than quadratic but less efficient than linear or logarithmic complexities.
   - **Example**: Efficient sorting algorithms like mergesort or quicksort.

5. **Quadratic Time: \(O(n^2)\)**
   - **Description**: The operation's time complexity grows quadratically with the input size. Often seen in algorithms with nested loops over the data.
   - **Example**: Bubble sort or insertion sort.

6. **Cubic Time: \(O(n^3)\)**
   - **Description**: The time complexity grows cubically with the input size. It is less efficient for large data sets.
   - **Example**: Certain naive matrix multiplication algorithms.

7. **Exponential Time: \(O(2^n)\)**
   - **Description**: The time complexity grows exponentially with the input size. Such algorithms become infeasible for even moderately large inputs.
   - **Example**: Certain brute-force algorithms, like solving the Traveling Salesman Problem through brute force.

8. **Factorial Time: \(O(n!)\)**
   - **Description**: The time complexity grows factorially with the input size, typically representing algorithms that generate all permutations of the input.
   - **Example**: Solving problems by generating all possible permutations.

Each of these notations gives an idea of how scalable an algorithm or operation is with respect to the size of its inputs. The lower the complexity, the more scalable the algorithm generally is.

### 2. Terminology

2a. **Collision** in a Hash Table
   - **Explanation**: A collision in a hash table occurs when two different keys are hashed (i.e., transformed by a hash function) to the same hash value or index in the hash table. Since each position in a hash table can ideally hold only one value, a collision creates a problem of where to store the second value. To resolve this, hash tables use methods like chaining (where each cell of the table becomes a list to hold multiple items) or open addressing (where a different slot is found using a certain probing technique).

2b. **Exception-Neutral** Function
   - **Explanation**: A function (or more broadly, a piece of code) is said to be exception-neutral when it neither handles nor explicitly throws exceptions itself but instead lets any exceptions pass through it unchanged to the caller. This term is commonly used in the context of C++ exception handling. An exception-neutral function maintains a neutral stance towards exceptions: it neither resolves (catches) them nor creates them, effectively maintaining the exception behavior of the functions it calls.

2c. **Stable** Sorting Algorithm
   - **Explanation**: A sorting algorithm is said to be stable if it preserves the relative order of equal elements in the sorted output as they were in the input. In other words, if two elements are equal according to the sorting criterion, their order relative to each other remains unchanged after sorting. Stability is an important property when the sorting criterion is not the only aspect of importance. For instance, when sorting records by one field (say, last name), you might want to preserve their original order with respect to another field (like first name) in case of a tie in the last names.

### Question 3

### 3a. Constant Time vs. Amortized Constant Time

- **Constant Time**: An operation is in constant time if it always takes the same amount of time, regardless of the input size.
- **Amortized Constant Time**: An operation is in amortized constant time if, over a series of operations, the average time for each operation is constant. Some operations may take longer, but the average time is constant.

### 3b. Example of Amortized Constant Time Operation

- **Example**: Adding an element to a dynamic array (like an ArrayList in Java or list in Python) is typically an amortized constant time operation. Normally, adding an element is fast, but occasionally, the array must resize (which takes longer). Over many additions, the average time per addition remains constant.

5a. **Array**

5b. **Explanation for Desirability of Arrays with Cache Prefetching**:

- **Memory Layout**: Arrays store their elements in contiguous memory locations. This means elements are placed right next to each other in memory.

- **Cache Prefetching**: When a processor uses cache prefetching, it not only loads the requested memory address but also nearby addresses. Since array elements are stored contiguously, accessing one element means the nearby elements are likely also loaded into the cache.

- **Efficiency**: This makes subsequent accesses to nearby elements much faster, as they are likely already in the cache. This is particularly beneficial for operations that process array elements sequentially.

- **Linked Lists**: In contrast, linked lists store elements in nodes that are not necessarily contiguous in memory. Each node contains the data and a pointer to the next node. This scattered storage means that prefetching is less effective, as adjacent memory locations might not contain relevant data.

- **Conclusion**: Therefore, the array structure benefits more from cache prefetching due to its contiguous memory allocation, making it generally more desirable in contexts where cache prefetching is a significant factor.

### 6. Efficiency of Table Operations. 
Complete the following. State the order of the three single-item Table ADT operations (retrieve, insert, delete) when a Table is implemented as indicated below. Remember that you are being asked for worst-case performance!

To provide the worst-case performance for the single-item Table ADT operations (retrieve, insert, delete) for each of the given implementations, we'll look at each case:

#### 1. (Smart) Sorted Array

- **Retrieve**: \(O(n)\). In the worst case, a linear search might be needed if a binary search is not used or not possible.
- **Insert**: \(O(n)\). In the worst case, inserting an element requires shifting all elements after the insertion point.
- **Delete**: \(O(n)\). Similar to insert, deleting an element might require shifting elements to fill the gap.

#### 2. Binary Search Tree

- **Retrieve**: \(O(n)\). In the worst case, the tree might be degenerated into a linked list (unbalanced).
- **Insert**: \(O(n)\). Similarly, if the tree is unbalanced, it could degrade to a linked list structure.
- **Delete**: \(O(n)\). Deleting a node in an unbalanced tree might require traversing most of the nodes.

#### 3. Red-Black Tree

- **Retrieve**: \(O(\log n)\). Red-black trees are self-balancing, ensuring a more consistent performance.
- **Insert**: \(O(\log n)\). Insertions require at most \(O(\log n)\) time due to the properties of red-black trees.
- **Delete**: \(O(\log n)\). Deletion also benefits from the self-balancing nature of red-black trees.

#### 4. Hash Table

- **Retrieve**: \(O(n)\). In the worst case, all elements might be in the same bucket, requiring a linear search.
- **Insert**: \(O(n)\). Similarly, inserting might involve traversing all elements if they hash to the same bucket.
- **Delete**: \(O(n)\). Worst case would involve searching through all elements in the same bucket.

Note: These worst-case scenarios often assume certain conditions, like an unbalanced tree or poor hash function leading to collisions. In typical, optimized cases, the performance can be much better.

### 11. Analyzing a Recursive Algorithm.

Analyzing a Recursive Algorithm. Consider the following function template meow, which takes a range of int values, specified using a pair of random-access iterators.
```cpp
     // Requirements on Types:
     //     RAIter must be a random-access iterator type.
     //     The value type of RAIter must be int.
     template<typename RAIter>
     int meow(RAIter first, RAIter last)
     {
         size_t n = last - first;
         // BASE CASE
         if (n <= 1) return 7;
         // RECURSIVE CASE
         int val = first[1];
         // Size of range
         // Must exist, since n >= 2
         RAIter mid = first + n/2;  // Iterator to middle of range
         int a = meow(first, mid);  // Recursive calls
         int b = meow(mid, last);
         return a * b + val;        // Final value
     }
```
Letting _n_ represent the size of the given range, find the order of this function. Show your work. Note that meow is recursive!
To determine the order of the recursive function `meow`, we need to analyze how the recursion behaves and how many times the function is called for a given input size \( n \).

#### Understanding the Function

1. **Base Case**: If ( n \leq 1 \), the function returns a constant. This is a base case and takes constant time, \( O(1) \).

2. **Recursive Case**: The function makes two recursive calls, each time with approximately half the size of the current range. This is because the range is divided into two parts: from `first` to `mid`, and from `mid` to `last`.

#### Recurrence Relation

The function's behavior can be described by the recurrence relation:

\[ T(n) = 2T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + f(n) \]

where \( f(n) \) represents the non-recursive work done in each call, which in this case is constant (calculating `mid`, `val`, and the final return value).

#### Solving the Recurrence

This recurrence relation is a case of the Master Theorem, where \( a = 2 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( f(n) = O(1) \). The Master Theorem states that:

- If \( f(n) = O(n^{\log_b a - \epsilon}) \) for some \( \epsilon > 0 \), then \( T(n) = O(n^{\log_b a}) \).
- If \( f(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_b a}) \), then \( T(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_b a} \log n) \).
- If \( f(n) = \Omega(n^{\log_b a + \epsilon}) \) for some \( \epsilon > 0 \), and if \( af(n/b) \leq kf(n) \) for some \( k < 1 \) and sufficiently large \( n \), then \( T(n) = \Theta(f(n)) \).

Here, \( a = 2 \), \( b = 2 \), so \( \log_b a = 1 \). Since \( f(n) = O(1) \), it fits the first case of the Master Theorem:

\[ T(n) = O(n^{\log_2 2}) = O(n^1) = O(n) \]

#### Conclusion

The order of the `meow` function, therefore, is \( O(n) \). This means the time complexity grows linearly with the size of the given range.

### Table Operation Efficiency 
The efficiency of table operations, such as retrieve, insert, delete, and traverse, can vary significantly depending on the specific data structure used to implement the table. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, binary search trees, and hash tables. Here's a general overview of the efficiency of these operations in each structure:

1. **Array (Unsorted):**
   - Retrieve: O(n) — Linear search is needed.
   - Insert: O(1) — If space is available and insertion is at the end.
   - Delete: O(n) — Requires shifting elements.
   - Traverse: O(n) — Linear traversal.

2. **Array (Sorted):**
   - Retrieve: O(log n) — Binary search can be used.
   - Insert: O(n) — Finding the position takes O(log n), but insertion requires shifting elements.
   - Delete: O(n) — After finding the element, shifting is needed.
   - Traverse: O(n) — Linear traversal.

3. **Linked List (Unsorted or Sorted):**
   - Retrieve: O(n) — Linear search.
   - Insert: O(1) for unsorted (if inserting at the beginning); O(n) for sorted to find the correct position.
   - Delete: O(n) — Search for the element and then remove it.
   - Traverse: O(n) — Linear traversal.

4. **Binary Search Tree (Balanced, e.g., AVL or Red-Black Tree):**
   - Retrieve: O(log n) — Based on the height of the tree.
   - Insert: O(log n) — Find the right place and insert.
   - Delete: O(log n) — Find the node and then delete using BST rules.
   - Traverse: O(n) — In-order traversal to visit all nodes.

5. **Hash Table:**
   - Retrieve: O(1) average; O(n) worst-case if many collisions occur.
   - Insert: O(1) average; O(n) worst-case for the same reason.
   - Delete: O(1) average; O(n) worst-case.
   - Traverse: O(n) — Must visit each bucket and handle collisions.

These efficiencies assume average-case scenarios for some structures, like hash tables, and balanced conditions for trees. The actual performance can vary based on specific implementation details, the nature of the data, and the operations performed.
